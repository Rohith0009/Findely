### **What Is This?** - It Allows you to search and check if a word is there in a sentence or not. It also shows has a option to show how many times it is repeated. (see features below).

### **How to Download:** Click the "[Releases]" link on the right, then on the latest release, under the latest version click to download "Findely.exe". (The name might have the release number in it.)

## **Features**

* ### 2 Different Modes:
  * **Simple**: Does the Basics Of the App! It Just Scans And tells If The word is found or not.
  * **Complex**: Does Way More The Than the Complex Mode! It can check how many times the word is repeated, Where it is located and more!


## **Purpose**

The main purpose of this app is to help you check if a word is present or not in a very big sentence and some more things!

## **Usage Notes**

1. **IF IT FREEZES** while running, it is probably because you clicked within the command prompt window which pauses everything. **To unfreeze it, simply-right click within the window, or press the Escape key.**

2. I'm a total amateur, so if something doesn't work I'll try to fix it but might not even know how, so don't expect too much.
